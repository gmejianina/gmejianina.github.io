Hello!
-----

My name is **Gabriel**. I graduated with a Master's in Data Analytics in 2019, and ever since I have continued my learning journey online.  

This blog is my attempt at having an online presence, documenting some of my projects, sharing things I learn, and ultimately giving something back to the community. 

If you would like to chat, don't hesitate to [send me a message on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielmejianina/) or [shoot me an email.](mailto:gmejia@outlook.com)
